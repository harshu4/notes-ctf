nmap :- map em all

Used to scan port and networks (rustscan may replace) current standard


RFC : 793 states that if  a connection does not exist(Port is close) send
a RST response

Many firewall drop tcp packets instead of sending RST hence port can be identified
as filtered iptables can be used to change this response

Different Types of Scan

Syn Scan (-sS) : Also called stealth scan sends syn requests and instead
                 of sending ack after syn/ack sends RST , needs root permission
                 not detectable

TCP Scan (-sT) : Tries to establish a normal three way handshake, same rules for
                 filtered and closed port


UDP Scan (-sU)  : UDP connections are stateless, when a packet is sent and no
                  response is receieved the packet is marked as open|filtered
                  when the UDP port is closed the target should respond with an ICMP
                  packet containing message that port is unreachable

Null Scan (-sN) : sends TCP packet with no flags set at all, according to RFC
                  if the port is closed host has to respond with RST

FIN scan(-sF) :  sends a TCP packet with fin flag set , expects an RST response
                  if port is closed

Xmas Scan(-sX) : sends a malformed TCP with URG,PSH and FIN flag on , expects
                  RST in response for closed Port


Ping sweep : used to find active host in a network infrastructure

-sn : pings with ICMP notation
192.168.0.1-254 or 192.168.0.0/24 (don't mess with the first 24 bits)

Firewall evasion is necessary sometimes , windows block all ICMP packets
-Pn tells nmap scan port without checking if host is up or notation

-f : split packets into smaller pieces
--scan-delay : names says it all
--badsum : send bad checksum , tcp/ip stack would drop the request but firewall may
           respond without checking


Nmap Scripts : Lua Lua Lua

Scripts of different categories are available : safe,intrusive etc etc

--script=<category>
--script=<script-name>
--script=<script-name> --script-args <script-name>.<arg>=<value>,<script-name>.<arg2>=<value2>,

all scripts are stored in /usr/share/nmap/scripts/

use script.db is a grepable db to find Scripts
add script and use nmap --script-updatedb


-O : os fingerprinting
-A : aggressive scanning Os,version etc
-v : verbose lvl1
-p- : scan all ports


All tcp flags :

PSH : push them all to application layer
URG : Urgent send me first please
FIN : Close connection softly
RST : I am out or you are fired
ACK : Acknowledge
SYN : Let's talk shall we ?
